The story
-------
It may quietly be the first tech startup from the land of freedom fighters (Cuncolim, if you didn't know!).

Brain child one of Goa's very own son born and raised in Cuncolim. There is a small story behind this fresh startup from Goa. 
It started with the notion of being one's own boss! and good deal of research and hard work in the field of freight forwarders and
logistics and how much pain it is to find a transporter who will transport your good from point A to point B for a bargain!

FreightRates
--------
The first baby of the company is '[FreightRates](http://freightrates.in)', an online platform
making sure that you (yes you!) get the best deals to transport you freight from source to destination. If your a transporter,
then we will make sure that you always have a truck full of goods!
